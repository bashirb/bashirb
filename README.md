# Bashir Bashir 👋

I'm a Fulbright scholar and business analytics master's student who's passionate about data and how to utilize it to solve real-world problems. I have an academic background in business, psychology and analytics and I'm commited to self learning through online courses and bootcamps to expand my skillset . I thrive in environments that value a growth mindset and constant learning and when many fields of knowledge intersect.
